# SweetSnip

A simple and easy to use screenshot tool for Windows built with wxWidgets that I wrote for myself. It's similar to Microsofts "Snipping Tool" except for the following:

1. I did not build an editing window because image editing software already exists that comes with Windows, Mac, and Linux distributions.

2. It has more options. These options include:

  - Automatically saving a bitmap to a folder.
  
  - Background, shape, and outline color for when you click and drag mouse to capture a portion of the screen. There's also transparency      options for the background and shape.
  
  - Global hotkey setting that is configurable. This exists only on Windows.
  
  - Configurable sound setting. The user can choose whether they want a sound to play after they take a snippet. If they choose to play a     sound, they can select any custom .wav sound file that resides in a directory.
  
  - SweetSnip does not sit in the taskbar unlike Microsofts Snipping Tool. SweetSnip sits in the system tray instead.
  
3. The GUI isn't the prettiest. I wrote this entirely by hand. I did not use any GUI builders.

The following are ideas that I may implement in the future depending on if I need them:

1. .PNG, .GIF, .BMP formats. Currently, it automatically and only saves snippets as a .jpg file because other formats have transparency.

2. If I really need to, a small and simple editing tool within SweetSnip
